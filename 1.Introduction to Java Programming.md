# Introduction to Java Programming

## Primitive Data Types

* Java has tighter type checking

```java=
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

int x = sc.nextInt();

if (x) // Type mismatch: cannot convert from int to boolean
  System.out.printIn("Positive number");
else
  System.out.printIn("Negative number");
```

## Declare Reference

* declare variable without instantiation will become reference variable

```java=
Scanner sc; // reference to scanner
```

## Instantiation of Variables or Objects

* primitive types: **must not** use `new`
* non-primitive types: **must** use `new`

:::info
Array in Java is also a non-primitive type. So, you need to use `new`:
```java=
int arr[] = new int[10];
```

## Protected Member

* Protected members only visible to subclass within same package

## MIL

* No MIL in Java


## Constructor

* Java provides default constructor if you don't define one
* No default copy constructor(even implicit) in Java
