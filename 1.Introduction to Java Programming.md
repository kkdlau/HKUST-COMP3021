# Introduction to Java Programming

[TOC]

## Primitive Data Types

* All characters are stored as **16-bit unsigned integer using Unicode**
* Java has **tighter** type checking

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

int x = sc.nextInt();

if (x) // Type mismatch: cannot convert from int to boolean
  System.out.printIn("Positive number");
else
  System.out.printIn("Negative number");
```
## `final`

* **`final`**: the final keyword is equivalent to a const pointer -> reference unchangeable
  * **class method**: no subclasses / overriding allowed
  * **variable**: can be set exactly once
  * **method parameter**: it cannot be modified within the method

## Arithmetic Operations

*  if one of the operands is in **double** type
    * the result of the operations **is double also**

## Type Casting

* same as C++

## switch statement

* switch statement only accpet integral type (from COMP201 Summer 2007)
  * `float`, `double`, and `boolean` are not accepted

## Lambda Expression

```java=
(<parameter>) -> { /* code blocks */ }
```

* can be converted into functional objects

## Array Assignment

```java=
int arr1[] = new int[10];
int arr2[] = new int[10];

arr1 = arr2; // just rereference, not copying
```

```java
int[] arr = new int[10];

/*
 * invalid, java only know this is a set
 */
arr = {1, 2, 3};

arr = new int[]{1, 2, 3}; // valid
```
## Declare Reference

* declare variable without instantiation will become reference variable

```java
Scanner sc; // reference to scanner
```


## Instantiation of Variables or Objects

* primitive types: **must not** use `new`
* non-primitive types: **must** use `new`

:::info
Array in Java is also a non-primitive type. So, you need to use `new`:
```java
int[] arr = new int[10];
```

## Protected Member

* Protected members only visible to subclass within same package
* And from other classes in the same package

## MIL

* No MIL in Java


## Constructor

* Java provides default constructor if you don't define one
* No default copy constructor(even implicit) in Java

## Inheritance

* Every constructor of a subclass must directly or indirectly call constructor of its superclass
* If subclass constructor does not call a superclass constructor explicitly, then default constructor of superclass will be called implicitly

```java=
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
  // instance variables
  private double length;
  private double width;
  
  public Rectangle() {
    // super() is implicity called here
    length = 0;
    width = 0;
  }
}
```


## Tricky Question I got from Google

```java
int i = Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1;
byte b = Byte.MAX_VALUE + 1;
```

Q: which statement(s) will cause compiler error? (can no compiler error)

A: `byte b = Byte.MAX_VALUE + 1;` will cause compiler error (overflow error). It is because `Byte.MAX_VALUE + 1` is **considered as integer literal**, and assigning intger value which **exceed byte representation range**.

`Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1` is considered as integer literal so assigning integer literal to `int` is fine.

To manually create the compiler error for the int statement, change `+1` to `+1L`. Now the addition statement is considered as **long integer literal**, so the compiler error raises.
