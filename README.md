# COMP3021 Java Programming (Spring 2021)

Repo for COMP2021 notes, assignments, and lab.

## About Note

Actually I type the notes on Hackmd. And Hackmd supports some syntax that github doesn't support. I would recommend you to clone this repo and use other markdown previewer to open it.

## Midterm Past Paper

In my semester they only released Spring 2016 & Spring 2017, which can be easily found on Peter Gao.

And there is the course website for COMP3021 Spring 2016, which posted Spring 2014 Past Paper:
