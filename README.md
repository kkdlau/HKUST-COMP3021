## About Note

Actually I type the notes on Hackmd. And Hackmd supports some syntax that github doesn't support. I would recommend you to clone this repo and use other markdown previewer to open it.

## Midterm Past Paper

In my semester they only released Spring 2016 & Spring 2017, which can be easily found on Peter Gao.

And there is the course website for COMP3021 Spring 2016, which posted Spring 2014 Past Paper:

## Comments on Spring 2021 Midterm Exam

* mind your carefulness
* not difficult, but the way they ask your questions are confusing
