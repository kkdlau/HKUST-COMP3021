# Java Programming: Class & Objects

[TOC]

## Class Initialization
> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23093470/java-order-of-initialization-and-instantiation

* Class is initialized **upon first access**
* Steps of initialization
  * Assigning compile time constant fields
  * Recursively initializing the superclass (if not already initialized)
  * Static initializers
* Is not triggered by accessing compile time constants
* Usually be triggered when accessing non-compile time constants

## Initialization of Instance Variables

* All are inherent from `java.lang.Object`
  * by default, `toString()` is provided
* Must be explicitly initialized
* For instance variable, the value of a reference variable is `null` by default (by compiler)
  * `int` / `char`: `0` / `\u0000`
  * `boolean`: `false`
* For local variable defined in a function scope, the default value is **garbage** 

### Constructor

* no return type
* same name as the class (how about factory method?)
  * can be overloaded
* If constructor is defined, default constructor is created by Java
  * This default constructor will call the no-argument constructor of the superclass


## Variable Copying

### Primitive Type

* Copying

### Non-primitive Type

* Referencing
* The object that no longer be referenced will be `recycled` by JVM
  * Done by reference counting / stop-the-world garbage collection

### Call-by-Value & Call-by-Reference

* All Java methods are call-by-value, instead of call-by-reference. (from COMP201 Summer 2006)
  * that means, all parameters' value are copied to method (including value of reference)


## Garbage Collection
* Objects are managed by JVM in the heap
* Explicitly assigning `null` can help JVM to collect garbage

## Memory
* **`Stack`**: contain method-specific values that are short-lived, and references to other objects in the heap
  * e.g. function call, local reference, primitive type values
* **`Heap`**: contain all **object instances**
* **`Literals`**: `string`, constant data

## Static Variables

* Variables shared by all class instance
* Lives in `static data`

## Class Variables
* Variables that initialized when an class instance is created
* live in heap
 
## Static Methods
* Including static function
* Lives in static data
* can only be accessed static variables
* Static methods can only use static variables of the class, NOT non-static variables (i.e. instance variables).

## Import Class from other packages
* using fullname to avoid `import`

```java
java.util.Date date = new java.util.Date(); // java will know where to find
```

* using `import`:

```java
import java.util.*;

Date date = new Date();
```

## Access Modifiers

* `public`: public to all classes
* `default`: only visible to it own package
* `private`: only visible to its class

:::info
only `public` and `default` class can be defined.

## Array

> https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java/exp/ch04_06.htm

* Array is `Object`, not primitive type
* Elements in array are `null` by default
  * Initialization is done for `Array`
* **`{}`**: syntax sugar, which is a C-like method to initialize data members

* Multidimensional array:
  ```java
  ChessPiece[][] chessBoard;
  chessBoard = new ChessPiece [8][8];
  chessBoard[0][0] = new ChessPiece( "Rook" ); 
  chessBoard[1][0] = new ChessPiece( "Pawn" );
  ```

* Irregular 2D array
  
  ```java
  int []][] triangle = new int [5][];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < triangle.length; i++) {    
    triangle[i] = new int [i + 1];
  }
  ```

## Immutable `Objects` and `Class`

* Data members are immutable
  * Even all data members are private, but reference of data member is returned
  * Still mutable!
