# Java Programming: Inheritance & Polymorphism

[TOC]

## Inheritance

* **Cosntructors** are not inherited
* **Instance variables** & **methods** are inherited (except `private`)

## **`super`** keyword

* for calling superclass constructors
  * **must** be put on the first line
* for calling superclass methods
  * you cannot use class name to do so
* `super` only be inserted for constructors which dont have `this()` and `super()`

:::info
**Mutli-class in a file**

Assuming there are three classes (only one is public) in a file. After compilation, there will be **three bytecode files**:
* classA.class
* classB.class
* classC.class
:::

## **`this`** keyword

* a constructor can only have either `super` or `this`, **but not both**

```java=
class Person {
  public Person() {
    System.out.println("(1) Person's no-arg constructor is invoked");
  }
}
class Employee extends Person {
  public Employee() {
    super(); // error
    this("(2) Invoke Employeeâ€™s overloaded constructor");
    System.out.println("(3) Employee's no-arg constructor is invoked");
  }
  public Employee(String s) {
  System.out.println(s);
  }
}

public class Faculty extends Employee {
  public static void main(String[] args) { new Faculty(); }
  public Faculty() {
    System.out.println("(4) Faculty's no-arg constructor is invoked");
  }
}
```


:::info
**toString()**

In fact all Java objects inhert `Java.lang.Object`, which provides `toString()`. While concatenating string with object, java will call `toString()` automatically.
:::

## Overloading

* Methods with different parameters

## Static Binding

* keywords for static binding:
  * `static`: since cannot be overriden (can be redefining only), static binding is possible
  * `final`: same reason
  * `private`: private method cannot be overriden, so it is "final"
* `Type` information is used for determining binding
  * that means, **compiler only use reference type** to check which method to call
* overloaded methods also use static binding to determine which method to call

## Accessibility Modifiers

* private: same as C++
* default: it is package private, that means only visible to same package
* protected: it is package private + subclass, that means
## Overridding

* Method name & parameters must be the same
  * return type can be the subclass type of original return type
  * accessibility cannot be reduced
    * e.g. **valid**: `protected` -> `public`
    * e.g. **invalid**: `public` -> `private`
* **`@Override`**: remind Java to override the method
* An instance method can be overriden if and only if it is accessible (i.e. `private` cannot be overriden)
* You can define same private method, but that is not overriding
  * No dynamic binding
  * It is unique method
* You can define same static method (not dynamic binding)
  * It is considered as **redefining**, not overriding
  * the **original static method** will be hidden
* You **can only override methods from superclass**, but no same class (from COMP201 Summer 2007)
  ```java
  class Test {
    public void m() {}
    
    @Override // error: not overriding superclass method
    public void m() {}
  }
  ```
* **Superclass constructor** can call **subclass methods**
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45184440/calling-a-subclass-method-from-superclass-constructor
  * The behaviour isn't the same as c++
 

### `equals()`

* Provided by `Object`
* comparing **value of reference**
  ```java
  // Original implementation in Object
  public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    return (this == obj);
  }
  ```
  *  `==`: stronger comparison, return `true` iff **same ref** and **same type**
* can be overriden to compare content of objects

### Static Method Hiding

* Original staic method is hidden
* However, it is still static binding
* `super` is not available for static method
  * `super` is considered as **an instance**, not class name

```java
// assuming static method test is defined
class Person;

// assuming static method test is also defined
class Employee extends Person; 

class Entrance {
  static public void main(String[] args) {
    Employee e = new Employee();
    
    e.test(); // Test defined in Employee is called
    
    Person p = new Employee();
    p.test(); // Test defined in Person is called
  }
}

```

**Exam Question: 2011 Midterm Q8**
What is the output of the following program?

```java
class A {
    private void a() {
        System.out.println("A.a");
    }

    public void b() {
        System.out.println("A.b");
    }

    public void ab() {
        a();
        b();
    }
}

public class B extends A {
    private void a() {
        System.out.println("B.a");
    }

    public void b() {
        System.out.println("B.b");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new B().ab();
    }
}
```

**ANSWER:**
```c
A.a // private method - static binding
B.b // public overriden method - dynamic binding
```

> Q12 is also worth to do.

## Method Matching vs Dynamic Binding

* First perform **Method Matching**, then **Dynamic Binding**

### Method Matching

* done by using reference type
* match parameter type and return type
* if compiler cannot find that, compiler error raises

### Dynamic Binding

* done by JVM
* look up the function according to the class hierarchy


## Casting and `instanceof`

* Explicit casting: same as C/C++
* `instanceof`: checking the runtime type of object


## Initializer

* Explicit field Initializer
  * Can only assgin value, but **not logic operation**
  * e.g. `double GPA = 4.0;`
* Intsance Initializer Block
  * Same as Explicit field Initializer, but support logic operation
* Constructor


### Execution Order of Initializer

1. Data fields are initialized to default values
2. Field initalizers and instance initializer blocks 
3. Constructor


:::success
Example: Execution Order of Initializer

```java

class A {
  int test = 0;
}

class B extends A {
  double gpa = test;
  
  {
    gpa *= 2.0;
  }
  
  B() {
  }
}
```

Execution order (assuming constructor B is called):
* Enter `B()`
* Enter `super()`
  * Intialize data fields **of A**
  * Run field initializers **of A**
  * Run intializer blocks **of A**
  * Run **the content of super contructor**
* **Finish executing** `super()`
* Intialize data fields **of B**
* Run field initializers **of B**
* Run intializer blocks **of B**
* Run **the content of B contructor**
* Finish executing `B()`
